# InfiPrint
InfiPrint is a Belt 3D Printer that I have been working on since late 2020. It is meant as a much cheaper alternative to other Belt 3D Printer alternatives such as the Creality CR-30 Belt printer or the ones from BlackBelt 3D. This is an open source project that anyone is welcome to come and build or contribute to.
